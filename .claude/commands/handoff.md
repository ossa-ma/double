End-of-session handoff - capture what matters from our conversation.

description: End-of-session summary
---

Append a concise handoff entry to `~/memory/.inbox.md`.

**Format:**
```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] Session: [One-line description]

Learnings:
- [Reusable insight, 1-2 lines max]
- [Pattern/principle, no examples unless essential]

Technical Content:
- [New knowledge for engineering files, terse]

Decisions:
- [Decision + why, only if reusable beyond this task]
```

**Capture reusable insights only:**
- Architecture decisions (why X over Y)
- Patterns/principles that apply broadly
- Technical knowledge for engineering files
- Non-obvious blockers or next steps

**Don't capture:**
- Specific edits ("moved X to Y")
- Task status ("finished feature X")
- One-off decisions without broader lesson
- Obvious next steps

**Style:** Short, direct, informal. One line per insight. No fluff. Examples only when essential.
